    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>wide mouth 1 quart jar</li>
      <li>8 to 10 pickling cucumbers (4–6 inches long), washed and dried</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pickling salt or sea salt</li>
      <li>1 quart water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons mustard seeds</li>
      <li>2 cloves peeled garlic</li>
      <li>1 stem dill, preferably flowering</li>
      <li>fresh horseradish root, about 1 inch long</li>
      <li>bay leaf</li>
      <li>Cherry, grape, blackcurrant, or oak leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Tightly pack the cucumbers into the sterile jar, you want to squeeze
        them in, so they’ll stay submerged and not float to the top of the
        liquid
      </li>
      <li>Add the salt to the water and bring to a boil, cool</li>
      <li>
        Add the mustard seeds, garlic, dill (fold to fit), horseradish, bay
        leaf, and other leaf if you have one
      </li>
      <li>
        Fill the jar with the salt water to within 1/4 from the top, all of your
        ingredients should be covered
      </li>
      <li>
        Loosely cap the jar with a sterile lid, the lid must be loose to allow
        the gases produced during fermentation to escape, some brine may seep
        out, so store where this won’t be a problem
      </li>
      <li>As it ferments, the brine will become cloudy</li>
      <li>
        Depending on your taste, the cucumbers will be ready to eat in 1 to 3
        weeks
      </li>
      <li>
        Fermentation will end after 5-6 weeks, if you have any left at this
        point, the lids should be tightened to prevent spoilage
      </li>
    </ol>
